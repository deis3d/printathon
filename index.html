		<h1>Information</h1>
		<h3 class='date'>March 17 - 18 | Brandeis University</h3>
		<div class="container">
			<div class='information--left'>
				<p>On Saturday March 25th Deis3D, Brandeis University’s 3D Printing club, and Brandeis' MakerLab kicked off their fourth annual
					Printathon. This year, the social justice themed event brought over 60 participants to Brandeis’ Library, where they competed
					for 24 hours to design and build a prototype to meet this year’s challenge: “Make it Human.”</p>
				<p>Over the course of the 24 hour event, participants brainstormed, designed and 3D printed their final project from scratch.
					To aid them in that process, Lucas Ewing from Autodesk and Michael Maher from Solidworks came to give workshops and tutorials
					of each company’s respective 3D design software. When it came to phyically printing their designs, participants used their
					own printers, those owned by Deis3D or Brandeis’ MakerLab, as well as four lent by MakerGear. By Saturday evening, more
					than 30 different 3D printers were at work!</p>
			</div>

			<div class='information--right'>
				<p>To add some additional inspiration, several specialists in the tech world gave talks and advice throughout the event. Ira
					Perlow, creator of the Phoenix Bios system, gave advice to participants about engineering and shared his stories from the
					early days of computing. Later in the evening, Drew Houston, the CEO of Dropbox called in to give support and answer questions
					about creating a startup.</p>
				<p>The winners of the event got to take home some fantastic prizes, ranging from 3D printers, to 3D printing filament, to 3D
					printing software licenses and printing credits. All of these were donated by the sponsors of the Printathon. Look below
					to see each of the winning teams and their creations.</p>

		<h2>This year's theme is <span>Make it Human</span></h2>
		<p>The idea behind the theme was to create something that either attaches to a human, or is something that a human physically uses to accomplish a task. This theme follows the Printathon theme of creating broad, social-justice-oriented ideas, intended to spark creativity and help make the world a better place. This year's projects were judged based on their adherance to the theme, as well as properties such as how useful the project was, how marketable it would be, and how well it was printed. As usual, all entries were fantastic, making our judge's decissions very difficult!</p>
